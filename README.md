# react-indexeddb

React hooks to use IndexedDB.

## Contributing

This project uses [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to keep track of changes and publish new versions. Once you've made your change, make sure to run the following command to describe and finalize your changes:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Your changes and description will be included in the changelog once a new version is released.

## Publishing

A new version is published to NPM and Github Releases automatically with Github Actions. The workflow will look for new changes in the `main` branch and create a PR for it. Once that PR is merged, a new version is released. You can find the action [here](./.github/workflows/release.yml).
